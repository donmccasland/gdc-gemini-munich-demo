  "threat_profile": {
    "origin": {
      "type": "Suspected Insider Threat / Activist Group",
      "description": "Initial indicators suggest a disgruntled former employee with technical expertise or a small, locally-based activist group protesting environmental concerns related to the facility's operations.",
      "motivation": "Disruption of services, potential financial damage, reputational harm, and/or to highlight perceived environmental damage.",
      "capabilities": "Likely possesses detailed knowledge of facility layout and operational procedures. May have access to schematics, passwords, or physical access points. Likely small group with limited resources but capable of coordinated actions."
    },
    "vulnerability_exploited": {
      "physical_security": "Weak perimeter security, inadequate surveillance in remote areas, insufficient background checks on personnel.",
      "cyber_physical_systems": "Outdated control system software, weak authentication protocols, lack of network segmentation.",
      "human_factor": "Low security awareness training, potential for social engineering attacks."
    },
    "attack_vector": {
      "initial_entry": "Potential for unauthorized physical access via compromised employee or unsecured access point. Network access may be gained through phishing or exploitation of vulnerable control systems.",
      "propagation": "Once inside the facility, the attacker(s) may directly manipulate equipment, introduce malicious code into control systems, or disrupt critical processes."

    "immediate_actions": [
      "Immediately secure the pump station and surrounding areas.",
      "Conduct a thorough damage assessment and implement emergency repairs.",
      "Review security logs and surveillance footage to identify potential suspects.",
      "Alert law enforcement and relevant regulatory agencies.",
      "Implement emergency water rationing procedures."
