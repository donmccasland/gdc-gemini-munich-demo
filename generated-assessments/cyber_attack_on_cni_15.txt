THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT - CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE CYBER INCIDENT

**Report ID:** 2024-10-26-CNI-001
**Date Issued:** 2024-10-26
**Classification:** Sensitive - For Official Use Only

**Executive Summary:**

This report assesses a potential cyberattack targeting critical national infrastructure (CNI). Analysis indicates a credible threat actor is actively probing and attempting to exploit vulnerabilities within a major water treatment facility's SCADA systems. The potential impact ranges from service disruption to contamination risks and public health concerns. Immediate mitigation measures are recommended.

**1. Incident Overview**

**Event Trigger:** Detection of anomalous network traffic emanating from a known botnet command and control (C2) server to the SCADA network of WaterCorp Facility Delta.

**Infrastructure at Risk:** WaterCorp Facility Delta - Primary water treatment plant servicing City Alpha. Specific systems vulnerable include:
    * Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) controlling chemical dosing.
    * Human-Machine Interface (HMI) systems for monitoring and control.
    * Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) servers.

**2. Threat Actor Details**

**Principal Adversary:** APT42 (Attributed to Iran-nexus state-sponsored group).
**Supporting Evidence:**
    * IP address overlap with previously identified APT42 infrastructure.
    * Use of custom malware variants associated with APT42 campaigns.
    * Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) align with APT42's historical targeting of industrial control systems.
**Motivation:** Potential disruption of critical infrastructure for geopolitical gain or to exert influence.

**3. Attack Vector & Methodology**

**Initial Access:** Suspected spear-phishing campaign targeting WaterCorp employees. Stolen credentials likely used to gain access to the internal network.
**Lateral Movement:** Internal reconnaissance using compromised accounts to identify and access the SCADA network.
**Exploitation:** Attempted exploitation of known vulnerabilities in outdated Rockwell Automation PLCs (CVE-2020-12345) and Siemens S7-1200 PLCs (CVE-2020-15782).
**Payload Delivery:** Potential deployment of a custom ICS-specific malware designed to manipulate chemical dosing parameters.
**Tactics Observed:**
    * Credential Stuffing
    * Vulnerability Scanning (NMAP)
    * Brute Force Attacks (RDP and SSH)
    * DLL Side-Loading
    * Data Exfiltration (SCADA configuration files)

**4. Temporal Analysis**

**Attack Chronology:**
    * **2024-10-15 08:00 UTC:** Initial spear-phishing emails sent to WaterCorp employees.
    * **2024-10-17 14:30 UTC:** Compromised account used to access the internal network.
    * **2024-10-20 09:00 UTC:** Lateral movement to the SCADA network detected.
    * **2024-10-25 22:00 UTC:** Vulnerability scanning and attempted exploitation of PLCs.
    * **2024-10-26 06:00 UTC:** Detection of anomalous network traffic indicating potential payload delivery.

**Estimated Timeline for Impact:** The attacker has already gained access to the SCADA network and is actively attempting to exploit vulnerabilities. An attack leading to service disruption or contamination could occur within the next 24-48 hours.

**5. Potential Impact Assessment**

**Severity:** High
**Impact Scenarios:**
    * Disruption of water treatment services, leading to water shortages.
    * Manipulation of chemical dosing, potentially contaminating the water supply with harmful chemicals.
    * Damage to critical infrastructure equipment, requiring costly repairs and downtime.
    * Loss of public trust and confidence in the water utility.

**6. Mitigation Recommendations**

* Immediately isolate the SCADA network from the internal network.
* Implement multi-factor authentication for all remote access and critical systems.
* Patch all known vulnerabilities in PLCs and SCADA servers.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.
* Review and update incident response plans.
* Conduct security awareness training for employees on phishing and social engineering tactics.
* Increase monitoring of SCADA systems and network traffic for any suspicious activity.
* Consider a complete audit of the water treatment facilityâ€™s cybersecurity posture.

**7. Intelligence Gaps**

* Specific details regarding the custom ICS-specific malware.
* Exact capabilities of the attacker within the SCADA network.
* Full scope of the attacker's objectives.

**8. Reporting & Dissemination**

This report should be disseminated to relevant stakeholders within WaterCorp, government agencies, and other critical infrastructure providers.
