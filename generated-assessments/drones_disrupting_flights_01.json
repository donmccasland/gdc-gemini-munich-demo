  "issueDate": "2024-10-27T14:30:00Z",
  "threatProfile": {
    "eventInitiator": {
      "attackerType": "Unknown",
      "motivation": "Multiple possible motivations, including: recreational misuse, intentional disruption of air traffic, industrial espionage (observing aircraft approaches/departures), or terrorism.",
      "technicalSophistication": "Varies. Can range from basic consumer-grade drones operated by inexperienced users to sophisticated, modified UAS platforms operated by skilled actors.",
      "probableOrigin": {
        "geographicArea": "Proximity to airport operating areas. Likely within a 5-mile radius initially, possibility extending up to 10 miles.",
        "jurisdictionalContext": "Likely subject to FAA regulations regarding drone operation near airports. State and local regulations may also apply."
      }
    },
    "impactedAsset": {
      "assetType": "Commercial and general aviation aircraft",
      "assetLocation": "Airspace surrounding [Airport Name/ICAO Code]. Specifically, approach and departure corridors.",
      "potentialDamage": "Near misses, forced diversions, flight delays, runway closures, potential for mid-air collision leading to catastrophic damage, loss of life, and economic disruption. Psychological impact on passengers and crew.",
	    "affectedParties": ["Airline operators", "Passengers", "Airport Authority", "Air traffic controllers", "Ground crew", "Local businesses"]
    },
    "exploitationVector": {
      "methodOfAttack": "Unauthorized operation of UAS within controlled airspace, creating a hazard to aviation. Visual obstruction of pilots, disruption of air traffic control communications (via jamming or spoofing), potential for physical impact with aircraft.",
      "attackDetails": "UAS observed flying at altitudes and in locations inconsistent with regulations. Pilot reports of UAS sightings near approach path to runway [Runway Number]. Multiple reports received from air traffic control regarding UAS presence on radar screens. No known communication with air traffic control.",
      "severityLevel": "High",
      "likelihood": "Medium. Previous incidents of UAS incursions near airports indicate a recurring threat. Increased recreational drone use contributes to the likelihood."
