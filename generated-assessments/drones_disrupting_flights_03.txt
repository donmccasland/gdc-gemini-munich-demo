THREAT ASSESSMENT: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Flight Disruption

**Subject:** Potential Disruption of Commercial Air Traffic by Civilian Drones

**Date Prepared:** 2024-02-29

**1. Threat Identification:**

   *Nature of Hazard:* Unauthorized and potentially malicious operation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, within or near controlled airspace surrounding [EXAMPLE AIRPORT NAME] and approach/departure flight paths. This poses a significant risk to commercial air traffic safety and operational efficiency.

**2. Origin of Threat:**

   *Likely Perpetrators:*
      *  **Negligent Operators:** Hobbyists or inexperienced drone users unaware of regulations, airspace restrictions, or the dangers posed to aircraft.
      *  **Malicious Actors (Low-Sophistication):** Individuals or small groups seeking to disrupt air traffic for attention, protest, or petty sabotage. Likely using readily available consumer-grade drones.
      *  **Malicious Actors (High-Sophistication, less likely but not negligible):** Terrorist organizations or state-sponsored actors seeking to cause significant damage, casualties, or economic disruption through coordinated drone attacks. These actors would likely possess advanced drone technology and expertise.
      *  **Industrial Espionage (Low Likelihood):** Competitors attempting to disrupt operations or gather intelligence through drone-based surveillance or targeted interference with air traffic control systems (unlikely but theoretically possible).

**3. Potential Impacts:**

   *Affected Entity:* [EXAMPLE AIRPORT NAME], airlines operating to/from the airport, passengers, air traffic control (ATC) personnel, and the surrounding community.

   *Possible Ramifications:*
      *  **Near-Miss Incidents:** Close proximity of drones to commercial aircraft, potentially leading to collisions.
      *  **Flight Delays & Cancellations:** Air traffic disruption and airspace closures due to drone sightings or incidents. Significant economic losses for airlines and the airport.
      *  **Equipment Damage:** Potential damage to aircraft engines or other critical systems from drone collisions.
      *  **Loss of Life:** In a worst-case scenario, a drone collision could contribute to a fatal aircraft accident.
      *  **Reputational Damage:** Negative publicity for [EXAMPLE AIRPORT NAME] and airlines operating there. Erodes public trust in air travel safety.
      *  **Compromised Security:** Drones could be used to deliver contraband to restricted areas or gather intelligence on security procedures.

**4. Methodologies of Attack:**

   *Attack Vectors:*
      *  **Visual Obstruction:** Drones flown near flight paths, causing pilots to take evasive action.
      *  **Physical Collision:** Direct impact of a drone with an aircraft, potentially causing significant damage.
      *  **Electronic Interference:** Intentional or unintentional interference with aircraft navigation or communication systems. This could include GPS jamming or spoofing.
      *  **Payload Delivery:** Drones carrying explosives or other dangerous materials intended to damage aircraft or infrastructure. (Low likelihood, but high impact if successful).
      *  **Surveillance & Reconnaissance:** Use of drones to gather intelligence on airport security procedures, vulnerabilities, and high-value targets.

**5. Temporal Aspects:**

   *Timeline of Potential Incident:* Incidents can occur at any time, but are more likely during periods of increased drone activity (e.g., weekends, holidays, local events). Furthermore, attacks are more likely during periods of reduced visibility (dawn/dusk or inclement weather) when drone detection is more challenging.

   *Specific Incident Examples (Hypothetical):*
      *  **Date/Time:** 2024-03-15, 16:00 local time
         *Description:* Report of multiple drone sightings near the approach path for Runway 27 at [EXAMPLE AIRPORT NAME]. Air traffic control issues a temporary ground stop for all inbound flights.
      *  **Date/Time:** 2024-04-01, 07:30 local time
         *Description:* A drone collides with the wing of a departing aircraft at [EXAMPLE AIRPORT NAME]. The aircraft is able to return safely, but the wing sustains significant damage.
      * **Date/Time:** Ongoing, but particularly concentrated between 20:00-23:00 local time
         *Description:* Increased reports of unauthorized drones flying over airport perimeter fence, suggestive of reconnaissance activities.

**6. Vulnerabilities:**

   *Weak Points:*
      *  Limited drone detection capabilities at [EXAMPLE AIRPORT NAME].
      *  Inadequate enforcement of drone regulations in the vicinity of the airport.
      *  Lack of public awareness regarding the dangers of flying drones near airports.
      *  Potential vulnerabilities in aircraft systems that could be exploited by sophisticated drone attacks (e.g., GPS spoofing).

**7. Mitigation Strategies:**

   *Recommended Actions:*
      *  Enhance drone detection and tracking capabilities at [EXAMPLE AIRPORT NAME] using radar, acoustic sensors, and visual observation systems.
      *  Increase enforcement of drone regulations in the vicinity of the airport through increased patrols and fines.
      *  Conduct public awareness campaigns to educate drone users about the dangers of flying near airports and the consequences of violating regulations.
      *  Invest in research and development of counter-drone technologies, such as drone jamming systems and net capture devices.
      *  Develop and implement robust emergency response plans for drone-related incidents.
      *  Strengthen cooperation between the airport, airlines, law enforcement, and government agencies to address the drone threat.

**8. Risk Assessment:**

   *Overall Threat Level:* Elevated. The potential for drone-related incidents at [EXAMPLE AIRPORT NAME] is increasing due to the growing popularity of drones and the increasing sophistication of drone technology. Continued vigilance and proactive mitigation efforts are essential to protect air traffic safety and security.
