Threat Assessment: Unauthorized Drone Activity Disrupting Air Traffic

**Subject:** Potential Disruption of Flight Operations due to Unauthorized Drone Activity

**Issue Synopsis:** Recent incidents involving drones operating within or near controlled airspace pose a significant and escalating threat to the safety and efficiency of flight operations at [Airport Name] and surrounding airspace. This assessment evaluates the potential risks and outlines recommended mitigation strategies.

**Assessment Date:** 2024-02-29

**1. Threat Actor Profile (Origin):**

*   **Primary Concern:** Recreational drone operators, lacking awareness of airspace regulations or possessing a disregard for aviation safety. Often operating drones purchased at retail outlets.
*   **Secondary Concern:** Malicious actors intentionally seeking to disrupt air traffic, potentially including individuals or groups aiming to cause economic damage or create public fear.
*   **Possible Motivation:** Ranges from ignorance/negligence to vandalism, terrorism, or economic sabotage.

**2. Affected Entity (Target):**

*   **Direct Impact:** Aircraft operating to/from [Airport Name], including commercial airliners, cargo planes, and general aviation aircraft.
*   **Indirect Impact:** Passengers, airport personnel, air traffic controllers, airlines, and the broader aviation industry.
*   **Critical Assets:** Runway 16/34 approach and departure paths, navigational aids (ILS, VOR), Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications systems, and aircraft themselves.

**3. Methodology of Disruption (Attack Method):**

*   **Primary Vector:** Unauthorized drone incursions into restricted airspace, violating FAA regulations and creating a collision hazard.
*   **Tactics & Techniques:**
    *   Unintentional intrusion due to lack of awareness or improper flight planning.
    *   Intentional disruption by flying drones near aircraft, interfering with approach/departure procedures, or causing diversions/delays.
    *   Potential for drone-borne payloads (e.g., explosives, disruptive devices targeting navigation equipment), although this is considered a lower probability but higher impact scenario.
*   **Means & Capabilities:** Readily available consumer-grade drones, enhanced with GPS spoofing or other modifications in more sophisticated threat scenarios.

**4. Temporal Considerations (Attack Timing):**

*   **Recent Incidents:** Multiple reported sightings of drones near [Airport Name] over the past 3 months. Specific incident details:
    *   2024-02-15, 14:30 EST: Drone sighted 2 miles west of Runway 16 approach, altitude approximately 800ft. Flight delayed by 30 minutes.
    *   2024-02-22, 21:00 EST: Drone reported near the airport perimeter fence, altitude unknown. Police investigation underway.
*   **Projected Timing:** Threat likely to increase during peak travel seasons (summer, holidays) and times of day with high flight volume. Weekends also present an elevated risk due to increased recreational drone activity. Reduced visibility conditions may exacerbate the hazard.

**5. Impact Assessment:**

*   **High:** Potential for mid-air collision, resulting in loss of life and significant property damage.
*   **Medium:** Flight delays, diversions, cancellations, and economic losses for airlines and the airport.
*   **Low:** Damage to airport infrastructure, reputational damage to the airport and aviation industry.
