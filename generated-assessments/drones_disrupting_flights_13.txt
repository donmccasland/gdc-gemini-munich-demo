## Threat Assessment: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Flight Disruption

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date Issued:** 2024-02-29
**Classification:** For Official Use Only

**Executive Summary:** This assessment evaluates the potential threat posed by Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), commonly known as drones, to commercial and private air traffic. The increasing accessibility and sophistication of UAS technology present a growing risk of intentional or unintentional disruptions to flight operations, potentially leading to significant safety and economic consequences.

**1. Threat Actor Profile (Origin & Intent):**

*   **Actor Category:** Varies; includes malicious actors, negligent operators, and technically unsophisticated users.
*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Malicious:** Sabotage, terrorism (e.g., disrupting critical infrastructure), extortion, intelligence gathering, vandalism.
    *   **Negligent:** Carelessness, lack of knowledge of aviation regulations, inadequate training.
    *   **Accidental:** System malfunction, loss of control, GPS interference.
*   **Capabilities:** Range from basic consumer drones with limited capabilities to advanced systems with extended range, sophisticated navigation, and payload capacities (e.g., carrying jamming equipment).
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate - High. Increasing UAS ownership makes incidents more probable.

**2. Vulnerable Asset Identification (Attack Target):**

*   **Primary Target:** Commercial and private aircraft operating in controlled airspace (airports, approach/departure paths, airways).
*   **Secondary Targets:** Air traffic control systems (potential for jamming or spoofing), airport infrastructure (radar, communication towers).
*   **Impact Area:** Air traffic delays, flight cancellations, potential for mid-air collision, damage to aircraft, loss of life.

**3. Attack Vector Analysis (Attack Method):**

*   **Delivery Method:**
    *   **Direct Intrusion:** UAS flown directly into or near flight paths, creating a collision hazard.
    *   **Signal Interference:** UAS equipped with jamming devices to disrupt GPS, communication, or radar signals.
    *   **Payload Delivery:** UAS used to drop objects into airport grounds or onto aircraft (low probability, high consequence).
*   **Technical Sophistication:** Varies depending on the actor and the chosen method. Direct intrusion requires basic piloting skills; signal interference requires specialized equipment and knowledge.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Direct intrusion is relatively easy to detect visually or with radar. Signal interference can be more difficult to pinpoint.

**4. Temporal Considerations (Attack Timing):**

*   **Time of Day:** Attacks can occur at any time, but high-traffic periods (morning/evening rush hours) may be preferred for maximum disruption.
*   **Special Events:** Sporting events, political rallies, or other gatherings may provide opportunities for distraction or increased media attention.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Adverse weather conditions (fog, heavy rain) can exacerbate the risk by reducing visibility and increasing reliance on automated systems.
*   **Observed Activity Window:** UAS incidents have occurred sporadically throughout the year, with no clear seasonal pattern identified to date.

**5. Threat Impact Assessment:**

*   **Severity:** High. Potential for catastrophic consequences, including loss of life and significant economic damage.
*   **Probability:** Moderate. The increasing prevalence of UAS technology and the lack of effective countermeasures make incidents increasingly likely.
*   **Risk Level:** High. Mitigation strategies are essential to reduce the risk of UAS-related flight disruptions.

**6. Mitigation Strategies (Summary):**

*   Enhanced radar and sensor technology for UAS detection and tracking.
*   Geofencing technologies to prevent UAS from entering restricted airspace.
*   Counter-UAS systems (e.g., jamming, drone capture).
*   Public awareness campaigns to educate UAS operators about aviation regulations.
*   Strict enforcement of UAS regulations and penalties for violations.
*   Improved coordination between aviation authorities, law enforcement, and UAS manufacturers.

**7. Assessment Limitations:**

*   This assessment is based on available information and may not reflect all potential threats.
*   The UAS threat landscape is constantly evolving, requiring ongoing monitoring and adaptation.

**8. Recommendation:**

Implement the mitigation strategies outlined in Section 6 to reduce the risk of UAS-related flight disruptions. Regularly review and update this assessment as new information becomes available.
